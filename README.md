# Task 3 â€“ AI Chatbot with NLP

## ðŸ§  Description
This task is part of my Python Developer Internship at **ELiteTEch**. The goal was to build a basic chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) that can respond to user queries.


---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
- Load and preprocess SMS data
- Convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF
- Train a machine learning model to classify spam
- Evaluate model performance using metrics and a confusion matrix
=======
- Use Python and NLTK to create an intelligent text-based assistant
- Process and understand user input using NLP techniques
- Respond based on intent and keywords

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
=======
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- `datetime` for time-based responses
- Simple NLP techniques (tokenization, stopword removal)

---

## ðŸ’¬ Supported Intents
- Greetings (hello, hi)
- Time queries
- Weather mentions
- Asking chatbotâ€™s name
- Help or support
- Thank you responses
- Jokes
- Python-related questions
- Farewell/Exit

---
