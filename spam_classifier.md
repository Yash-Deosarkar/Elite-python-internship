# Task 4 â€“ Machine Learning Model Implementation (Spam Detection)

## ðŸ§  Description
This task is part of my Python Developer Internship at **ELiteTEch**. The goal was to build a predictive machine learning model using scikit-learn to classify SMS messages as spam or ham.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
- Load and preprocess SMS data
- Convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF
- Train a machine learning model to classify spam
- Evaluate model performance using metrics and a confusion matrix

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
- `spam_classifier.py` â€“ Python script for training and evaluating the model
- `spam.csv` â€“ The dataset used for training/testing
- `confusion_matrix.png` â€“ Output visualization of prediction accuracy
